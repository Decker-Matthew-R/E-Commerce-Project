Planning Documents


These are some of the planning documents for an E-Commerce website I am working on. I will upload the actual website when it is fully complete. This documentation is a succession of phases, activity graphy, a list of requirements gathered after interviews (classmates played the customer), and a state machine diagram displaying functionality. 

Please let me know what I can improve!
